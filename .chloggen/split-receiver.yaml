  The import path for the OTLP receiver can now be access directly:
  - `go.opentelemetry.io/collector/receiver/otlpreceiver`
  
  If using this receiver, modify your Collector builder configuration to use `gomod` directly, such as:
  - `gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/receiver/otlpreceiver v0.64.0`
